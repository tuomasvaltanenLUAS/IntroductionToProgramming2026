# TASK 1: Create an application that greets the users
# based on given hour of the current time.
# Convert the given hour into integer format.
# Use the following logic while greeting the user:

# If hour is 05 - 11: respond "Good morning!"
# If hour is 12 - 17: respond "Good afternoon!"
# If hour is 18 - 21: respond "Good evening."
# If hour is 22 - 04: respond "Good night..."

# EXTRA TASK:
# if the user doesn't provide the hour (empty input)
# get the current hour from datetime-module

from datetime import datetime

# PHASE 1: ask the needed variable from the user
hour = input("Give the current hour:\n")

# IF THE USER INPUTS NOTHING, we replace the hour
# with datetime's hour value!
if hour == "":
    timestamp = datetime.now()
    hour = timestamp.hour
    print(f"Using current hour AUTOMATICALLY: {hour}")

# WHATEVER the hour currently is, convert to int
hour = int(hour)

# PHASE 2: program logic
if 5 <= hour <= 11:
    print("Good morning!")
elif 12 <= hour <= 17:
    print("Good afternoon!")
elif 18 <= hour <= 21:
    print("Good evening.")
else:
    print("Good night...")
