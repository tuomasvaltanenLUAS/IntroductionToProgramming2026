# TASK 1: Create an application that greets the users
# based on given hour of the current time.
# Convert the given hour into integer format.
# Use the following logic while greeting the user:

# If hour is 05 - 11: respond "Good morning!"
# If hour is 12 - 17: respond "Good afternoon!"
# If hour is 18 - 21: respond "Good evening."
# If hour is 22 - 04: respond "Good night..."

# PHASE 1: ask the needed variable from the user
hour = input("Give the current hour:\n")
hour = int(hour)

# PHASE 2: program logic => greet the user base on
# instructions above!
if 5 <= hour <= 11:
    print("Good morning!")
elif 12 <= hour <= 17:
    print("Good afternoon!")
elif 18 <= hour <= 21:
    print("Good evening.")
else:
    print("Good night...")
