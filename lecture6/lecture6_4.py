# reversing a text in Python is quite different
# than in other languages, BUT HEY, it works!
# basically this uses the substring-syntax
# but we choose all characters from beginning to end
# but TRAVERSE the string the other way (-1), from end to beginning!
# [ : : -1]
text = input("Give some text:\n")

# palindrome is a word that is the same forwards and backwords
# try racecar
# try tacocat
reversed_text = text[::-1]
print(reversed_text)
